                <h2>Fun facts about pandas</h2>
                <p>
                    Pandas are much bigger than your average teddy bear. An adult panda can weigh more than 45 Kg and can measure about 1.5 m. 
                    They start as small pink baby pandas (no fur) and grow up to get their black and white fur after 3 weeks.

                    Pandas are known to be lazy. They sleep and eat all day. But they can climb and even swim. They eat a lot of bamboo each day.
                    That in turn means they poop a lot as well.
